# Data Structure: Hash Table

## Description
Experiment with concepts of hash table. In this project, we can see how:
* Create attributes of the hash table
* Put the key-value pair into the hash table (the table will be rehashed if the number of buckets reaches the certain threshold)
* Get the value based on the associated key
* Remove the value based on the associated key
* Solve problems by using hash table
  * Find the first nonrepeated character of the string
  * Find the first repeated character of the string
